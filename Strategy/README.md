## Where the general strategy will live.

### First Algorithms/ Trading Bot Outline

 - Buy and Hold SPY, which is the ETF that tracks the S&P500 index.
 - We want to close our position as soon as it loses more than 10% or achieves a profit greater than 10%. 
 - After this we stop investing for a predetermined period of time such as one month. Thereafter we start this cycle all over again by investing in SPY again.
