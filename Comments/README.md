### Identify an 'Edge'

 - First we identify an edge then build a strategy around that said edge.(*Edge comes first*)
 - *Note* Just because a strategy achieves profitability in a given time frame doesn't mean it has a edge. A strategy that is not profitable can have an edge. 
  - Profitability isn't the main benchmark you compare your strategies performance to, instead you would want to compare your strategies performance to some relevant benchmark like some market index in the given sector(ex: S&P 500)
- While returns are great, we want to mitigate risk, so we compare the risk-reward on each trade/strategy.
