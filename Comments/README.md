### Identify an 'Edge'

 - First we identify an edge then build a strategy around that said edge.(*Edge comes first*)
 - ***Note:*** Just because a strategy achieves profitability in a given time frame doesn't mean it has an edge. A strategy that is not profitable can have an edge. 
 - Profitability isn't the main benchmark you compare your strategies performance to, instead you would want to compare your strategies performance to some relevant benchmark like some market index in the given sector(ex: S&P 500). If your strategy is being outperformed by said index then it most likely doesn't have an edge.
 - While returns are great, we want to mitigate risk, so we compare the risk and volatility associated with these returns.
 - If your strategy manages to generate excess returns over its respective benchmark over a significantly long period of time it likely has an edge, excess return is known as Alpha(α).
 - First step in developing trading algorithms is to find some form of Alpha(α), we do this by testing different hypothesis's. 
 - Testing hypothesis's is best done in a scientific manner using a systematic data driven approach. 
 - The good thing is there are numerous research papers done on trading strategies, you can also make your own.
 - For example one might be "Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks", to test this you have to clearly define what it means to be a "Small-cap" stock vs a "Large-cap" stock, you may clarify this by looking at the respective market capitalization for each. If you can find some correlation then you can potentially profit from this. Try to put it in logical terms tho, for example the reason that this hypothesis may work is that smaller cap stocks have more room to grow and are essentially in their early stages of growth compared to companies that are already established in growth.
